View Cards Option: Players can view their current hand's value at any time during their turn by entering 'v', adding clarity and strategic flexibility to gameplay.

Gameplay Improvements:
User-Friendly Prompts: Enhanced input prompts to make actions (hit, stand, or view cards) more intuitive and reduce the chance of incorrect input.
